# 🗝️ Caesar Cipher Web App  

**DESCRIPTION**  
A Caesar Cipher web app inspired by Roman cryptography — encrypt, decrypt, and experience ancient secrecy with modern interactivity.Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  

**FEATURES**  
- Encrypt or decrypt with a chosen shift  
- Interactive choice selector (Encrypt/Decrypt)  
- Typing effect when showing results  
- Dark/Light (“Night Camp”) mode  
- Mobile-friendly, responsive UI  
- Preserves case and non-alphabet characters  

**HOW IT WORKS**  
The message is transformed by rotating each alphabetic character by a fixed shift (0–25):  
- Uppercase and lowercase letters are shifted within A–Z / a–z  
- Non-letters (spaces, digits, punctuation) are left unchanged  
- Decryption reverses the shift (or uses 26 − shift)  

The application then provides:  
- Encrypted output (when “Encrypt” is selected)  
- Decrypted output (when “Decrypt” is selected)
